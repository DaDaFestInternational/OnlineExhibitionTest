            <h1>About the Artist.</h1>
			<p>Curating a life less ordinary, using creative & contemporary techniques to challenge the distressed edge of life. Zoe shares a passion for equality, particularly in the creative industries and understands the importance of establishing a clear framework, with a twist of creativity. A very experienced leader and consultant in her specialist field of cultural inclusion and accessible approaches.</p>
            <p>A contemporary visual artist who uses her experience of being partially blind and living with a chronic condition for over 50 years to create a unique perspective, with a historical and contemporary research led practice in her art. She develops installations, and viscerally powerful audio visual and tactile representations of Disabled people’s journeys and experiences through life, landscapes and built environments. Zoe has won several awards and scholarships. She showed ‘Domestic Landscapes’ 2022 in Madrid and across the UK funded by ONCE in Spain and Arts Council England. ‘Decoding Difference’ was shown at the London Festival of Design Biennial in June 2023 at Somerset House with international artists supported by Kings College. Recently she has been awarded the Henry Moore research fellowship 2023.</p>
            <p>An International conceptual artist specialising in Disability Art practice through 3-D dimensional and installation artworks.  She is experienced at working with Curators and gallery teams.</p>
            <p>‘Painting with Light’ is a series of neon lights using disability rights slogans and Zoe’s own insights to her own language around dispelling stereotypes. @tightcontrol was a reaction to a meeting in an NHS setting between Zoe and medical professionals who were frustrating her with their oppressive us of medical terms. In relation, the term @tightcontrol is used to reiterate the complexity of Zoe’s glucose levels and how disabled people are controlled by others. It is twofold in its irony and jest with how disabled people are controlled by others.</p>
            <p>A Fellow of the RSA</p>
